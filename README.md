# Sound Voltex Calculators (WIP)

Web application for players of the arcade game SOUND VOLTEX (SDVX) used to calculate score, grade, and volforce (coming soon).

This was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Currently deployed [here](https://brenbread.me/sdvx).

### Score
- Choose between **Subtractive** or **Classic** calculation methods
- **Subtractive**: Input max chain of a chart, then near and error values. Value for "critical" is calculated
- **Classic**: Input critical, near, and error values

### Grade
- Outputs max error or near values based on max chain input

### Volforce
- In progress

## Dependencies
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/)

## TODO
- Finish VOLFORCE calculator
- Add localStorage for inputs
